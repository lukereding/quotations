The natural phenomena of the evolutionary history of man claim an entirely

itself; and of all the various branches of the science of man, or anthropology,
the history of his natural evolution should excite his highest interest. :::

As a mathematical discipline travels far from its empirical source, or still
more, if it is a second and third generation only indirectly inspired from
ideas coming from 'reality', it is beset with very grave dangers. It becomes
more and more purely aestheticizing, more and more purely l'art pour l'art.
This need not be bad, if the field is surrounded by correlated subjects, which
still have closer empirical connections, or if the discipline is under the
influence of men with an exceptionally well-developed taste. But there is a
grave danger that the subject will develop along the line of least resistance,
that the stream, so far from its source, will separate into a multitude of
insignificant branches, and that the discipline will become a disorganized mass
of details and complexities. In other words, at a great distance from its
empirical source, or after much 'abstract' inbreeding, a mathematical subject
is in danger of degeneration. At the inception the style is usually classical;
when it shows signs of becoming baroque the danger signal is up. It would be
easy to give examples, to trace specific evolutions into the baroque and the
very high baroque, but this would be too technical. In any event, whenever this
stage is reached, the only remedy seems to me to be the rejuvenating return to
the source: the reinjection of more or less directly empirical ideas. I am
convinced that this is a necessary condition to conserve the freshness and the
vitality of the subject, and that this will remain so in the future. ::: John
von Neumann

You go to war with the data you have, not the data you wish you had. :::
Richard McElreath

Just about five-eighths (of a century) ago there was a sharp discontinuity:
algebra began to appear on the pages of the statistician's, journals. The
pioneering work of Karl Pearson spread out in many directions; that of Student
spread out in many others, including the analysis of economic time series.
Since that time the tools of the statistician have been sharpened on the
grindstone of algebra and hammered out on the anvil of mathematical models. We
learned rapidly that, to a far greater extent than we had dared to think, one
could use data to deal both with the uncertainties of nature and with the
uncertainties of data-based results. ::: John Tukey

I know of scarcely anything so apt to impress the imagination as the wonderful

wildest confusion.  The larger the mob, the greater the apparent anarchy, the
more perfect is its sway. It is the supreme law of unreason. ::: Sir Francis

I believe that, in the end, it is *applications* which justify mathematics. The

Hence, as more individuals are produced than can possibly survive, there must
in every case be a struggle for existence, either one individual with another
of the same species, or with the individuals of distinct species, or with the
physical conditions of life. It is the doctrine of Malthus applied with
manifold force to the whole animal and vegetable kingdoms; for in this case
there can be no artificial increase of food, and no prudential restraint from
marriage. Although some species may be now increasing, more or less rapidly, in
numbers, all cannot do so, for the world would not hold them. ::: Charles Darwin (The Origin)


Science is what we understand well enough to explain to a computer. Art is

Inventive genius requires pleasurable mental activity as a condition for its
vigorous exercise. 'Necessity is the mother of invention' is a silly proverb.
'Necessity is the mother of futile dodges' is much nearer to the truth. The
basis of the growth of modern invention is science, and science is almost
wholly the outgrowth of pleasurable intellectual curiosity. - A. N. Whitehead
(quote in Concrete Mathematics)

We may say that, before Maxwell, Physical Reality, in so far as it was to
represent the process of nature, was thought of as consisting in material
particles, whose variations consist only in movements governed by partial
differential equations. Since Maxwell's time, Physical Reality has been thought
of as represented by continuous fields, governed by partial differential
equations, and not capable of any mechanical interpretation. This change in the
conception of Reality is the most profound and the most fruitful that physics
has experienced since the time of Newton. ::: Einstein

Thought is only a flash between two long nights, but this flash is everything. ::: Henri Poincare ::: general ::: problem_solving

Species are merely those strongly marked races or local forms which, when in
contact, do not intermix, and when inhabiting distinct areas are generally
regarded to have had a separate origin, and to be incapable of producing a
fertile hybrid offspring.  But as the test of hybridity cannot be applied in
one case in ten thousand, and even if it could be applied, would prove nothing,
since it is founded on an assumption of the very question to be decided - and
as the test of origin is in every case inapplicable - and as, further, the test
of non-intermixture is useless, except in those rare cases where the most
closely allied species are found inhabiting the same area, it will be evident
that we have no means whatever of distinguishing so-called "true species" from
the several modes of variation here pointed out, and into which they so often
pass by an insensible gradation. :::  A.R. Wallace (1865; "On the phenomena of
variation and geographical distribution as illustrated by the Papilionidae of
the Malayan region", p. 12)

There is a strong and widely held belief that all organisms are perfect and
that everything within them is there for a function. Believers ascribe to the
Darwinian natural selection process a fastidious prescience that it cannot
possible have and some go so far as to think that patently useless features of
existing organisms are there as an investment for the future ...  Even today,
long after the discovery of repetitive sequences and introns, pointing out that
25% of our genome consists of millions of copies of one boring sequence, fails
to move audiences. They are all convinced by the argument that if this DNA were
totally useless, natural selection would already have removed it. Consequently,
it must have a function that still remains to be discovered. Some think that it
could even be there for evolution of the future—that is, to allow the creation
of new genes. As this was done in the past, they argue, why not in the future?
... Some years ago I noticed that there are two kinds of rubbish in the world
and that most languages have different words to distinguish them. There is the
rubbish we keep, which is junk, and the rubbish we throw away, which is
garbage. The excess DNA in our genomes is junk, and it is there because it is
harmless, as well as being useless, and because the molecular processes
generating extra DNA outpace those getting rid of it. Were the extra DNA to
become disadvantageous, it would become subject to selection, just as junk that
takes up too much space, or is beginning to smell, is instantly converted to
garbage. ::: Sydney Brenner

Using R is a bit akin to smoking. The beginning is difficult, one may get
headaches and even gag the first few times. But in the long run, it becomes
pleasurable and even addictive. Yet, deep down, for those willing to be honest,
there is something not fully healthy in it. ::: Francois Pinard

A genuine understanding of the key concepts and principles of the probability
theory is essential for any work in stochastic processes. These concepts are
simple, but treacherously so. There is probably no branch of mathematics in
which it is so easy to advance plausible sounding arguments that are in fact
wrong! ::: Cox & Davison, 1994, p. 25

Maybe it’s because I was raised as a Protestant and became an environmentalist,
but I’ve long been struck by the spiritual kinship of environmentalism and New
England Puritanism. Both belief systems are haunted by the feeling that simply
to be human is to be guilty. In the case of environmentalism, the feeling is
grounded in scientific fact. ::: Jonathan Franzen,
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/carbon-capture

What is found in biology is mechanisms, mechanisms built with chemical
components and that are often modified by other, later, mechanisms added to the
earlier ones. While Occam's razor is a useful tool in the physical sciences, it
can be a very dangerous implement in biology. It is thus very rash to use
simplicity and elegance as a guide in biological research. While DNA could be
claimed to be both simple and elegant, it must be remembered that DNA almost
certainly originated fairly close to the origin of life when things were
necessarily simple or they would not have got going.  Biologists must
constantly keep in mind that what they see was not designed, but rather
evolved. It might be thought, therefore, that evolutionary arguments would play
a large part in guiding biological research, but this is far from the case. It
is difficult enough to study what is happening now. To figure out exactly what
happened in evolution is even more difficult. Thus evolutionary achievements
can be used as hints to suggest possible lines of research, but it is highly
dangerous to trust them too much. It is all too easy to make mistaken
inferences unless the process involved is already very well understood. ::: Francis Crick

Ronald Fisher in England was an advocate of eugenics, and both he and Sewall
Wright in America formulated the principle of natural selection as a process of
increasing, from generation to generation, the average fitness of members of a
breeding population. Yet these formulations make no predictions about a general
progress of species. This may seem odd, since the process of natural selection
is supposed to make organisms more fit for their environment. So why does
evolution not result in a general increase of the fitness of life to the
external world? Wouldn’t that be progress? The reason that there is no general
progress is that the environments in which particular species live are
themselves changing and, relative to the organisms, are usually getting worse.
So most of natural selection is concerned with keeping up. Certainly quite new
kinds of making a living have been occasionally exploited in evolution, but
every species eventually becomes extinct (99.9 percent already have) and no way
of making a living will be around forever.4 Judging from the fossil record a
typical mammalian species lasts roughly ten million years, so we might expect
to last another nine million unless, as a consequence of our immense ability to
manipulate the physical world, we either extinguish ourselves a good deal
sooner or invent some extraordinary way to significantly postpone the
inevitable. ::: Richard Lewontin, http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2005/10/20/the-wars-over-evolution/

"Great" scientists are those who, like Newton, make laws that apply
universally, while lesser ones spend their lives dissecting particular
phenomena. ::: Richard Lewontin

That a theoretical formulation is desirable because it makes it easier and more
efficient to write more articles and books giving simple explanations for
phenomena that are complex and diverse seems a strange justification for work
that claims to be scientific. It confuses "understanding" in the weak sense of
making coherent and comprehensible statements about the real world with
“understanding” that means making correct statements about nature. It makes the
investigation of material nature into an intellectual game, disarming us in our
struggle to maintain science against mysticism. ::: Richard Lewontin

It is, I think, particularly in times of acknowledged crisis that scientists
have turned to philosophical analysis as a device for unlocking the riddles of

I was working down the aisle and a big, beefy, red-faced cracker soldier got up in front of me, so drunk he was weaving, and announced loud enough that everybody in the car heard him, “I’m going to fight you, nigger.” I remember the tension. I laughed and told him, “Sure, I’ll fight, but you’ve got too many clothes on.” He had on a big Army overcoat. He took that off, and I kept laughing and said he still had on too many. I was able to keep that cracker stripping off clothes until he stood there drunk with nothing on from his pants up, and the whole car was laughing at him, and some other soldiers got him out of the way. I went on. I never would forget that—that I couldn’t have whipped that white man as badly with a club as I had with my mind.

The state white people always in our house after the other whites I didn’t know had killed my father…the white people who kept calling my mother “crazy” to her face and before me and my brothers and sisters, until she finally was taken off by white people to the Kalamazoo asylum…the white judge and others who had split up the children…the Swerlins, the other whites around Mason…white youngsters I was in school there with, and the teachers—the one who told me in the eighth grade to “be a carpenter” because thinking of being a lawyer was foolish for a Negro….

“The Honorable Elijah Muhammad,” a small, gentle man, whom they sometimes referred to as “The Messenger of Allah.” He was, they said, “a black man, like us.” He had been born in America on a farm in Georgia. He had moved with his family to Detroit, and there had met a Mr. Wallace D. Fard who he claimed was “God in person.” Mr. Wallace D. Fard had given to Elijah Muhammad Allah’s message for the black people who were “the Lost-Found Nation of Islam here in this wilderness of North America.”

And where the religion of every other people on earth taught its believers of a God with whom they could identify, a God who at least looked like one of their own kind, the slavemaster injected his Christian religion into this “Negro.” This “Negro” was taught to worship an alien God having the same blond hair, pale skin, and blue eyes as the slavemaster. This religion taught the “Negro” that black was a curse. It taught him to hate everything black, including himself.

Any fornication was absolutely forbidden in the Nation of Islam. Any eating of the filthy pork, or other injurious or unhealthful foods; any use of tobacco, alcohol, or narcotics. No Muslim who followed Elijah Muhammad could dance, gamble, date, attend movies, or sports, or take long vacations from work. Muslims slept no more than health required. Any domestic quarreling, any discourtesy, especially to women, was not allowed. No lying or stealing, and no insubordination to civil authority, except on the grounds of religious obligation.

“The Christian religion is incompatible with the Negro’s aspirations for dignity and equality in America,” the student had written. “It has hindered where it might have helped; it has been evasive when it was morally bound to be forthright; it has separated believers on the basis of color, although it has declared its mission to be a universal brotherhood under Jesus Christ. Christian love is the white man’s love for himself and for his race. For the man who is not white, Islam is the hope for justice and equality in the world we must build tomorrow.”

“No! We reject segregation even more militantly than you say you do! We want separation, which is not the same! The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us that segregation is when your life and liberty are controlled, regulated, by someone else. To segregate means to control. Segregation is that which is forced upon inferiors by superiors. But separation is that which is done voluntarily, by two equals—for the good of both! The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us that as long as our people here in America are dependent upon the white man, we will always be begging him for jobs, food, clothing, and housing. And he will always control our lives, regulate our lives, and have the power to segregate us. The Negro here in America has been treated like a child. A child stays within the mother until the time of birth! When the time of birth arrives, the child must be separated, or it will destroy its mother and itself. The mother can’t carry that child after its time. The child cries for and needs its own world!”

I think that an objective reader may see how when I heard “The white man is the devil,” when I played back what had been my own experiences, it was inevitable that I would respond positively; then the next twelve years of my life were devoted and dedicated to propagating that phrase among the black people.

When I am dead—I say it that way because from the things I know, I do not expect to live long enough to read this book in its finished form—I want you to just watch and see if I’m not right in what I say: that the white man, in his press, is going to identify me with “hate.” He will make use of me dead, as he has made use of me alive, as a convenient symbol of “hatred”—and that will help him to escape facing the truth that all I have been doing is holding up a mirror to reflect, to show, the history of unspeakable crimes that his race has committed against my race.

when this white man saw Malcolm X, he instantly called across to him, “I don’t blame your people for turning to you. If I were a Negro I’d follow you, too. Keep up the fight!” Malcolm X said to the man very sincerely, “I wish I could have a white chapter of the people I meet like you.” The light changed, and as both cars drove on, Malcolm X quickly said to me, firmly, “Not only don’t write that, never repeat it. Mr. Muhammad would have a fit.” The significant thing about the incident, I later reflected, was that it was the first time I had ever heard him speak of Elijah Muhammad with anything less than reverence.

Protocol and common sense require that Negroes stand back and let the white man speak up for us, defend us, and lead us from behind the scene in our fight. This is the essence of Negro politics. But Malcolm said to hell with that! Get up off your knees and fight your own battles. That’s the way to win back your self-respect. That’s the way to make the white man respect you. And if he won’t let you live like a man, he certainly can’t keep you from dying like one!

He knew that the moment he allowed himself to feel to its fulness how they lived, the shame and misery of their lives, he would be swept out of himself with fear and despair. So he held toward them an attitude of iron reserve; he lived with them, but behind a wall, a curtain. And toward himself he was even more exacting. He knew that the moment he allowed what his life meant to enter fully into his consciousness, he would either kill himself or someone else. So he denied himself and acted tough.

He felt he had no physical existence at all right then; he was something he hated, the badge of shame which he knew was attached to a black skin. It was a shadowy region, a No Man’s Land, the ground that separated the white world from the black that he stood upon. He felt naked, transparent; he felt that this white man, having helped to put him down, having helped to deform him, held him up now to look at him and be amused. At that moment he felt toward Mary and Jan a dumb, cold, and inarticulate hate.

And, yet, out of it all, over and above all that had happened, impalpable but real, there remained to him a queer sense of power. He had done this. He had brought all this about. In all of his life these two murders were the most meaningful things that had ever happened to him. He was living, truly and deeply, no matter what others might think, looking at him with their blind eyes. Never had he had the chance to live out the consequences of his actions; never had his will been so free as in this night and day of fear and murder and flight.

He had been so conditioned in a cramped environment that hard words or kicks alone knocked him upright and made him capable of action—action that was futile because the world was too much for him.

He had killed within himself the preacher’s haunting picture of life even before he had killed Mary; that had been his first murder. And now the preacher made it walk before his eyes like a ghost in the night, creating within him a sense of exclusion that was as cold as a block of ice. Why should this thing rise now to plague him after he had pressed a pillow of fear and hate over its face to smother it to death? To those who wanted to kill him he was not human, not included in that picture of Creation; and that was why he had killed it. To live, he had created a new world for himself, and for that he was to die.

Economists Take Aim at Wealth Inequality By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ SAN FRANCISCO — When pundits and presidential candidates talk about inequality and the tiny sliver of the population whose fortunes have soared, they often drop names like Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, Sheldon Adelson and Mark Zuckerberg. But those are just the most visible members of a larger but less-talked-about cadre of the big winners in today’s economy. This group consists of roughly 250,000 Americans who mainly populate the executive offices and managerial suites of major companies and financial institutions, along with a smattering of top law firms, hedge funds and other elite aeries. These people — the top one-quarter of 1 percent of the country’s employed population — have enjoyed explosive gains in income and wealth in recent decades, even as salaries and wages stagnated for the typical American worker. “You hear about C.E.O.s, entertainers, athletes and hedge funders, but that’s the tip of the iceberg,” said Nicholas A. Bloom, a professor of economics at Stanford who is finishing a paper examining the underlying dynamics of income inequality. “It’s a much, much bigger group and they are outpacing everyone else.” Like those of many of his peers who are presenting new research at the annual meeting of the American Economic Association, which began here on Sunday and ends on Tuesday, Mr. Bloom’s findings are bringing to light fresh perspectives on why income inequality is growing and how it is reshaping the national and global economy. While the much-talked-about 1 percent is doing just fine, the supersize gains are taking place even further up the income ladder, according to what Mr. Bloom and four colleagues found by examining 35 years of data from the Social Security Administration. The phenomenon is not limited to Wall Street or the big banks — manufacturers rewarded their top executives every bit as generously as did firms in the finance, insurance and real estate sectors. And this pattern is being repeated in countries where the political landscape is quite different from that of the United States, like Sweden, Germany and Britain. “This is a truly global phenomenon, and I don’t know any serious economist who would deny inequality has gone up,” said Mr. Bloom, a native of Britain whose politics veer toward a laissez-faire approach and the Conservative Party there. “The debate is over the magnitude, not the direction.” The economic association’s meeting is something of a barometer of what concerns economists most, drawing more than 13,000 attendees from the ranks of academia, as well as research groups and the private sector. And in panels, research presentations and speeches, what was once mainly a preoccupation of ivory tower Marxists and other players on the margins of the profession is taking center stage. “In the last few years, there’s been a huge change in the mainstream of the profession,” said Steven Fazzari, an economics professor at Washington University in St. Louis who first came to the conference as a job-hunting graduate student in 1982. “The issue of income inequality was a backwater in the economics field, and it was largely ignored.” At the same time, there’s a growing consensus among economists of all ideological stripes that inequality is growing — in the United States and abroad — even if the usual political fault lines appear when the discussion turns to the consequences of the trend and whether new public policies are needed to address it. “It’s pretty much indisputable that the percentage of income being earned by the top 1 percent, or the top quarter of 1 percent, is going up,” said Richard H. Thaler, the association’s president. “It was true five years ago, but it was not as widely recognized,” said Mr. Thaler, a behavioral economist who teaches at the University of Chicago. “As with climate change, scientific consensus takes a while to build.” And, to borrow language from an economic seminar, there’s also a striking correlation between the emergence of income inequality as an issue here and the near-rock-star status accorded a handful of once-obscure experts on the subject inside and outside academia. The best known of these is Thomas Piketty, whose 700-page tome, “Capital in the Twenty-First Century,” became an improbable best-seller in 2014 and made the French academic a media superstar. Emmanuel Saez, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, who has collaborated with Mr. Piketty, won a MacArthur “genius” grant in 2010. Raj Chetty of Stanford, who has looked closely at economic mobility, also received a MacArthur grant and has presented findings to Hillary Clinton, Jeb Bush and Obama administration officials. “There are definitely fashions in the field,” said Dean Baker, co-director of the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington. “As much as most economists might hate to acknowledge it, there’s no way you can’t respond to Piketty’s success.” Anticipated presentations at the economic association meeting include new findings from David Autor, an influential M.I.T. economist, on the links between college performance and increased financial aid as well as research by Enrico Moretti of Berkeley into how state tax increases prompt the highest earners to move to lower-tax locations. For all the intense focus on the roots and extent of income inequality today, most academics are leery of any easy solution. At the same time, they acknowledge that their traditional tools are inadequate for the task. “There’s no reason the free market will solve this,” Mr. Bloom said. He believes inequality is being magnified by technological change and what’s known as skills bias, where workers with a particular expertise reap the biggest reward. Neither is amenable to quick fixes. In Professor Bloom’s new paper, which he wrote with David J. Price, a Stanford graduate student, and three other economists — Jae Song, Fatih Guvenen and Till von Wachter — the top quarter of 1 percent of Americans appears to be pulling away from the rest. For workers at this threshold, who earn at least $640,000 annually, their salaries rose 96 percent from 1981 to 2013, after taking account of inflation. The trend was especially pronounced among the most successful enterprises in the American economy, creating a divergence between the highest-paid people at companies that employ more than 10,000 people and the rest of the work force. In this rarefied circle, overall pay jumped 140 percent versus a 5 percent drop for the typical employee at these corporate behemoths. The split in compensation between executives and everyone else was much less pronounced at smaller companies, according to the research by Mr. Bloom and his colleagues. At these firms, between 1981 and 2013, top salaries rose 49 percent, while median pay rose 30 percent. In addition, Mr. Bloom and his team also found a sharp divergence between pay at the most successful companies and also-rans in the same field — think Apple versus BlackBerry. The highest-paid workers cluster at the winners, heightening income disparities in the overall work force. Mr. Bloom traces the outsize gains to large grants of stock and options to top workers at big companies, with their fortunes rising in line with the performance of the stock market. “There used to be a premium for working at a big company, even in a lower-level job,” he said. “That’s not true anymore. The people who have really suffered are lower-level employees at big companies.”

One reason these atrocities are still with us is that we have learned to bury them in a mass of other facts, as radioactive wastes are buried in containers in the earth. We have learned to give them exactly the same proportion of attention that teachers and writers often give them in the most respectable of classrooms and textbooks. This learned sense of moral proportion, coming from the apparent objectivity of the scholar, is accepted more easily than when it comes from politicians at press conferences. It is therefore more deadly.

The history of any country, presented as the history of a family, conceals fierce conflicts of interest (sometimes exploding, most often repressed) between conquerors and conquered, masters and slaves, capitalists and workers, dominators and dominated in race and sex. And in such a world of conflict, a world of victims and executioners, it is the job of thinking people, as Albert Camus suggested, not to be on the side of the executioners.

If there are necessary sacrifices to be made for human progress, is it not essential to hold to the principle that those to be sacrificed must make the decision themselves? We can all decide to give up something of ours, but do we have the right to throw into the pyre the children of others, or even our own children, for a progress which is not nearly as clear or present as sickness or health, life or death?

Then they were packed aboard the slave ships, in spaces not much bigger than coffins, chained together in the dark, wet slime of the ship’s bottom, choking in the stench of their own excrement. Documents of the time describe the conditions: The height, sometimes, between decks, was only eighteen inches; so that the unfortunate human beings could not turn around, or even on their sides, the elevation being less than the breadth of their shoulders; and here they are usually chained to the decks by the neck and legs. In such a place the sense of misery and suffocation is so great, that the Negroes . . . are driven to frenzy. On one occasion, hearing a great noise from belowdecks where the blacks were chained together, the sailors opened the hatches and found the slaves in different stages of suffocation, many dead, some having killed others in desperate attempts to breathe. Slaves often jumped overboard to drown rather than continue their suffering. To one observer a slave-deck was “so covered with blood and mucus that it resembled a slaughter house.”

By 1800, 10 to 15 million blacks had been transported as slaves to the Americas, representing perhaps one-third of those originally seized in Africa. It is roughly estimated that Africa lost 50 million human beings to death and slavery in those centuries we call the beginnings of modern Western civilization, at the hands of slave traders and plantation owners in Western Europe and America, the countries deemed the most advanced in the world.

What constitutes a critical mass, as the Supreme Court put it, of minority students at a place like Michigan remains subjective. As far as Robby Greenfield, a senior engineering student there and the former treasurer of the Black Student Union, is concerned, that number is still elusive. “There needs to be enough to culturally shift the dialogue on campus,” said Mr. Greenfield, who is from Atlanta and whose parents are doctors. After thinking about it for a moment, he added, only half-facetiously, “I think it should be the same as the percentage of Michigan football players who are black.”

In 1676, seventy years after Virginia was founded, a hundred years before it supplied leadership for the American Revolution, that colony faced a rebellion of white frontiersmen, joined by slaves and servants, a rebellion so threatening that the governor had to flee the burning capital of Jamestown, and England decided to send a thousand soldiers across the Atlantic, hoping to maintain order among forty thousand colonists. This was Bacon’s Rebellion.

Around 1776, certain important people in the English colonies made a discovery that would prove enormously useful for the next two hundred years. They found that by creating a nation, a symbol, a legal unity called the United States, they could take over land, profits, and political power from favorites of the British Empire. In the process, they could hold back a number of potential rebellions and create a consensus of popular support for the rule of a new, privileged leadership.

Patrick Henry’s oratory in Virginia pointed a way to relieve class tension between upper and lower classes and form a bond against the British. This was to find language inspiring to all classes, specific enough in its listing of grievances to charge people with anger against the British, vague enough to avoid class conflict among the rebels, and stirring enough to build patriotic feeling for the resistance movement.

According to Van Every, just before Jackson became President, in the 1820s, after the tumult of the War of 1812 and the Creek War, the southern Indians and the whites had settled down, often very close to one another, and were living in peace in a natural environment which seemed to have enough for all of them. They began to see common problems. Friendships developed. White men were allowed to visit the Indian communities and Indians often were guests in white homes.

The clash was not over slavery as a moral institution—most northerners did not care enough about slavery to make sacrifices for it, certainly not the sacrifice of war. It was not a clash of peoples (most northern whites were not economically favored, not politically powerful; most southern whites were poor farmers, not decisionmakers) but of elites. The northern elite wanted economic expansion—free land, free labor, a free market, a high protective tariff for manufacturers, a bank of the United States. The slave interests opposed all that; they saw Lincoln and the Republicans as making continuation of their pleasant and prosperous way of life impossible in the future.

They would do it with the aid of, and at the expense of, black labor, white labor, Chinese labor, European immigrant labor, female labor, rewarding them differently by race, sex, national origin, and social class, in such a way as to create separate levels of oppression—a skillful terracing to stabilize the pyramid of wealth.

The great majority of men are unwilling to endure that long self-denial and saving which makes accumulations possible . . . and hence it always has been, and until human nature is remodeled always will be true, that the wealth of a nation is in the hands of a few, while the many subsist upon the proceeds of their daily toil.

Control in modern times requires more than force, more than law. It requires that a population dangerously concentrated in cities and factories, whose lives are filled with cause for rebellion, be taught that all is right as it is. And so, the schools, the churches, the popular literature taught that to be rich was a sign of superiority, to be poor a sign of personal failure, and that the only way upward for a poor person was to climb into the ranks of the rich by extraordinary effort and extraordinary luck.

‘Star Wars,’ and How a Force Helps the Federal Reserve Robyn Beck/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images A Star Wars fan in Los Angeles last month. The movie has set box-office records, if you don’t take inflation into account. By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM This is a story about “Star Wars: The Force Awakens”… and the Federal Reserve. Wait! Keep reading. Some cheap tricks are entertaining. The movie, as of Sunday, had collected more money from American audiences than any other film in American history. In less than a month, its domestic box office receipts have totaled $812 million. This is a record. It is also a great example of “money illusion,” the human tendency to take nominal prices more seriously than actual value. The new “Star Wars” is not the most successful movie in American history. Adjusting for inflation, it has earned about half as much as the original “Star Wars” in 1977, according to Box Office Mojo. It lags even further behind the inflation-adjusted $1.74 billion haul of the real champion, “Gone With the Wind.” (Put differently, the money earned by “Gone With the Wind” in 1939 bought almost twice as much stuff as the new movie’s receipts.) Yet the nominal record strikes people as more interesting and important than the inflation-adjusted rankings. When I tweeted about the real rankings earlier this week, several people responded that I was a party-pooping pedant. Disney, which released the movie, is celebrating; the media is trumpeting the news; and the hullabaloo is likely to draw even more people to see “Star Wars” because, after all, everyone loves a winner. The emphasis on nominal box-office records makes it possible for Hollywood to portray the movie business as a growth industry. Every blockbuster is bigger than the last, every summer a record-setter. The reality is that the movie industry sold about 80 million tickets during an average week in 1930, or 65 tickets for every 100 Americans. In 2015, theaters sold about 23 million tickets a week, or 7 per 100 Americans. This emphasis on nominal records is successful because people prefer to pretend the value of money is constant. Research suggests we don’t even realize that we’re doing it. In a 1997 study, two-thirds of respondents judged that a worker who got a 5 percent raise during a period of 4 percent inflation would be happier than a worker who got a 2 percent raise during a period of zero inflation. And the illusion is more than a feeling. The same study asked respondents to imagine that their income and prices had both increased by 25 percent over the previous six months. Some 38 percent of respondents said they would be less likely to buy a leather armchair that now cost $500 rather than $400, while 43 percent said they would be more likely to sell a desk that was now worth $500 rather than $400. Inflation did not change the real value of the armchair and desk, but it did change people’s decisions. (Some economists refuse to believe that people are tricked by inflation, or at least that they err on a scale sufficient to affect economic patterns. These economists prefer to believe that people behave rationally, a belief that, in a wonderful instance of irony, happens itself to be irrational.) And now comes the part you’ve been waiting for: The money illusion doesn’t just help Hollywood. It also helps the Federal Reserve. People don’t like inflation. They tend to regard it as a kind of theft. And the confusion caused by inflation looks like an additional downside. But the Fed has concluded that a little inflation is a good thing. It aims to keep prices rising about 2 percent a year, and, at the moment, Fed officials are actually worried there isn’t enough inflation. Prices have climbed by significantly less than 2 percent in each of the last three years. In part, the Fed wants a little inflation simply to avoid deflation. Economists generally agree that a general decline in prices, or deflation, is more disruptive than a general increase, or inflation. Consumers delay purchases, awaiting better deals. Growth stalls, prices fall further, and it can be very hard to break the resulting cycle. Japan has been trying for two decades. Standard measures of inflation also tend to overstate it, so avoiding deflation actually requires keeping measured inflation above zero. One reason for the bias can be technological improvement. The first iPhone went on sale in 2007 for $599, and the price dropped significantly soon after. The most recent iPhone went for more, but the price increase ignores the vast quality improvement. The memory in the newest iPhone is twice as large as on the original; the camera is better; the display is sharper; it has more sensors; and there are a world of apps that make it a multiuse tool. Inflation also increases the Fed’s ability to stimulate the economy by cutting borrowing costs. Let’s say short-term interest rates are at 5 percent and inflation is at 2 percent when the economy falls off a cliff. If the Fed cuts rates to zero, while inflation remains at 2 percent, the cost of borrowing drops to negative 2 percent, increasing the impact of the stimulus. But on top of all of this, it turns out that the confusion caused by inflation — the money illusion — also has some important benefits. During economic downturns, businesses are often reluctant to cut wages, delaying necessary economic adjustments, because workers hate wage cuts. Inflation helps the medicine go down. Holding nominal wages steady, or raising wages more slowly than the pace of inflation, offers a more palatable route to gradually reducing the value of those wages. The money illusion also helps to reduce debt burdens. Sensible lenders would index contracts to inflation. Humans, focused on nominal value, generally do not, and so lenders suffer as inflation erodes promised receipts. Say a person makes $50,000 a year and takes a $300,000 mortgage loan. The payments would take 34 percent of pre-tax income. Now let’s say inflation boosts wages 2 percent a year. After a decade, the same monthly payment would take just 28 percent of that person’s monthly income. Inflation can similarly ease the burden of national debts. And, during good times, the money illusion helps to fuel what John Maynard Keynes memorably called the “animal spirits.” By inflating economic measures, it creates the appearance of greater prosperity, encouraging people to borrow more, spend more, risk more. It sends a clear message: Join the party, you must. The Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life. Follow us on Facebook and Twitter.

The treasurer of the American Longshoremen’s Union, Bolton Hall, wrote “A Peace Appeal to Labor,” which was widely circulated: If there is a war, you will furnish the corpses and the taxes, and others will get the glory. Speculators will make money out of it—that is, out of you. Men will get high prices for inferior supplies, leaky boats, for shoddy clothes and pasteboard shoes, and you will have to pay the bill, and the only satisfaction you will get is the privilege of hating your Spanish fellow-workmen, who are really your brothers and who have had as little to do with the wrongs of Cuba as you have.

It seems natural for people to blame their own misfortunes on the environment. It seems equally natural to blame other people’s misfortunes on their personalities. Just the opposite attribution, by the way, is made when things go well. When things go right, people credit their own abilities and intelligence. The onlookers do the reverse. When they see things go well for someone else, they sometimes credit the environment, or luck.

Depressed patients who failed to respond to antidepressant medication were given an increased dose of the drug, following which 72 per cent of them improved significantly by showing at least a 50 per cent reduction in symptoms of depression. The catch was that the dose had only been increased for half of the subjects. The others only thought the dose had been increased; in fact it had not. Yet the response rate was the same 72 per cent in both groups.

People whose symptoms have diminished by 49 per cent or less are classified as ‘non-responders’, and those whose symptoms improved by 50 per cent or more are classified as ‘responders’. The illusion lies in the implication that the ‘non-responders’ have not gotten better at all. In fact, many of them have experienced substantial clinical improvement, so much so that a very small boost - as little as one additional point of the 51-point Hamilton depression scale - can push them over the 50 per cent criterion, turning them into ‘responders’.

why were the drugs ever approved? The real answer to this question lies in the criteria that are used for antidepressant drug approval. The efficacy criterion used by drug regulators requires two ‘adequate and well-controlled’ clinical trials showing that a drug is better than a placebo. But there are some catches. The first catch is that there is no limit to the number of studies that can be run in order to find the two showing a statistically significant effect. Negative trials just don’t count. The second catch is that the size of the drug-placebo difference - its clinical significance - is not considered, although the published ‘apologia’ suggests that this might change.

Because of the power of the placebo effect, almost anything that is believed in seems to work for some types of medical problems. That is why the late Arthur K. Shapiro described the history of medicine as largely the history of the placebo effect.4 It is also why clinical experience alone cannot tell us whether a particular physical substance is an effective treatment.

In the best of circumstances - which is what the trial was designed to evaluate - only one out of three depressed patients showed a lasting recovery from depression, and since there was no evaluation of what the recovery rate might have been with placebo treatment, there is no way of knowing whether their recovery was actually due to the medication they had been given.

By getting rid of the patients who show a placebo response to the medication that is being investigated, the run-in should make the drugs look more effective than they actually are. This is a potential flaw in clinical-trial methodology that biases the trials in favour of the drug and against the placebo.

The chemical-imbalance hypothesis is that there is not enough serotonin, norepinephrine and/or dopamine in the synapses of the brain. This is more specifically termed the monoamine theory of depression, because both serotonin and norepinephrine belong to the class of neurotransmitters called monoamines.

In either case, the results of decades of neurotransmitter-depletion studies point to one inescapable conclusion: low levels of serotonin, norepinephrine or dopamine do not cause depression. Here is how the authors of the most complete meta-analysis of serotonin-depletion studies summarized the data: ‘Although previously the monoamine systems were considered to be responsible for the development of major depressive disorder (MDD), the available evidence to date does not support a direct causal relationship with MDD. There is no simple direct correlation of serotonin or norepinephrine levels in the brain and mood.’25

In the STAR*D trial, which was designed to be especially representative of what happens in real-world clinical practice, switching unresponsive depressed people from one SSRI to another was exactly as effective as switching them to an NDRI. When depressed people who did not respond to an SSRI were given an NDRI, 26 per cent of them got better, but 27 per cent of them also got better if the drug they were switched to was just another SSRI.29 Once again we have the remarkable coincidence of identical effects from different drugs.

Depressed people got better when given MAO and reuptake inhibitors as antidepressants, and this led researchers to conclude that depression must be caused by a chemical deficiency. But much (if not all) of that improvement turns out to be a placebo effect. So to understand depression and how it might be treated effectively, we need to examine the placebo effect more carefully.

Instead, the placebo effect depends on a host of factors. It depends, for example, on the condition being treated, the way in which the placebo is administered, the colour of the placebo, its price, whether it has a recognized brand name and the dose that is prescribed.
